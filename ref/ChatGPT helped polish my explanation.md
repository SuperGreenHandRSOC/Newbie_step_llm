About why Encoder-only model like BERT cannot handle text generation tasks, please help evaluate if the following explanation is comprehensive and accurate, and provide suggestions to help polish the expression: Encoders can merely comprehense the input as a whole, without considerate time series, so it's hard for them to generate new tokens especially without a prompt. Encoder-only models merely consist with encoders, so they can harly handle tenxt generation tasks.


Your explanation touches on key points but could be made clearer and more precise. Here's a revised version:

"Encoder-only models like BERT are designed to understand the input text as a whole rather than sequentially generating new tokens. They lack the ability to model time series or predict the next word in a sequence, which is essential for text generation tasks. Since these models only consist of encoders, they struggle with generating text, especially when there isn't a prompt guiding the generation process."

This revision clarifies the role of encoder-only models and why they aren't suited for text generation tasks, focusing on their inability to model sequences and predict subsequent tokens.
